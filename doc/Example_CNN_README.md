# Image Classification with CNN

Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images from a given dataset into predefined categories/classes.

## Project Results
In this project, we processed the CIFAR10 dataset of images and explored different classifiers results:
- Building a sequential CNN model from scratch
- Transfer learning from VGG16
- Transfer learning from ResNet50  (best results)
- Fine-tuning ResNet50

We deployed a simple gradio demo showing the classification results on unseen images.

### Python Modules
**helpers.py:** Helper module used my all the notebooks with useful methods to load and preprocess the dataset, evaluate the model, plot curves and confusion matrix, and so on.

### Additional Folders
**test_images**: folder of unseen images to test on the model

## Installation
Use **requirements.txt** to install the required packages to run the notebooks. It is advised to use a virtual environment.
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
